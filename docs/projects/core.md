## About this project

Litecoin enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world using peer-to-peer technology without a central authority. The management and processing of these transactions is carried out collectively by the decentralized Litecoin network. If you'd like to help support the network, you can do so by running Litecoin Core - the most popular full node Client - by following the instructions below.
