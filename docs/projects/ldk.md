# Litecoin Development Kit (LDK)

Litecoin Development Kit (LDK) is a proposed project that aims to port the functionality of the Bitcoin Development Kit (BDK) to the Litecoin ecosystem, thereby enabling developers to effortlessly build cross-platform Litecoin wallets while staying unencumbered by the technicalities of Litecoin internals.

## Core Features:

- **LDK Core Library:** The heart of our project which provides foundational wallet functions.
- **LDK CLI:** A command-line interface wallet library and a REPL tool designed for demonstrations and testing the capabilities of the LDK.
- **LDK FFI:** An experimental feature for generating foreign language bindings for LDK, expanding the horizons of potential applications.
- **LDK Documentation:** Comprehensive open-source documentation to assist developers in integrating and utilizing LDK.

## Why LDK?

BDK, with its solid foundation on the rust-bitcoin and rust-miniscript libraries, offers a simplified approach to integrating Bitcoin wallet functionalities into any application. By initiating LDK, we aspire to bring these seamless wallet creation capabilities to Litecoin, enabling developers to provide user-friendly Litecoin wallet solutions across various platforms.

## Involvement of the Litecoin Foundation

The Litecoin Foundation, being an ardent supporter of open-source projects and technological advancements within the Litecoin network, is keen on facilitating the LDK project. 

## Let's Build Together

We're not just looking to create a Litecoin equivalent of BDK – we’re seeking to build a vibrant community around it. Whether you’re a Rust developer or someone passionate about Litecoin and open-source development, your contributions are valuable to us.

### Contribute to the Development

Even if Rust isn’t your forte, there are several ways you can contribute to bringing LDK to life:
- **Developers**: If you're skilled in Rust, we need your expertise in porting and maintaining BDK for Litecoin.
- **Funders**: Support the developers by contributing to the bounty and ongoing development funds.
- **Advocates**: Help spread the word and keep the momentum going.
