## About this project

MWEB is the largest upgrade to the Litecoin network ever, promising to provide fungibility for all, while improving Litecoin's scalability. David Burkett, the lead developer behind Litecoinâ€™s Mimblewimble Extension Block (MWEB) upgrade, spent more than two years working on it.

The MWEB upgrade will be included as part of the Litecoin Core 0.21.2 release, which also includes Taproot.
