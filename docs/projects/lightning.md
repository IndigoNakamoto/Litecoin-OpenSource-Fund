## About this project

The Lightning Network was first proposed by Thaddeus Dryja and Joseph Poon in 2015. It was designed to solve one of the biggest problems cryptocurrencies face: scalability. Litecoin launched its Lightning Network in 2018.

The Lightning Network is a 2nd layer solution. Micropayments on the Lightning Network are guided by smart contracts; sets of rules that must be followed for transactions to take place. The fees are likely to be very small compared to the fees charged by miners on the main blockchain. The work done by Lightning Network nodes are far easier than that done by miners.
