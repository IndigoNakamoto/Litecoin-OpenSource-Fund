## About this project

OmniLite is an open-source platform that facilitates the creation of decentralized tokens and smart contracts as well as digital assets, like tokens and NFTs.

Being a layered protocol built on top of Litecoin’s blockchain, Omnilite has a distinct advantage over other blockchains due to its integrity, network security, scalability and comparatively low fees. The tokens created via OmniLite can be considered to be as an extension of Litecoin and as a result, the transactions from these tokens are recorded on Litecoin’s blockchain.

All digital assets created via OmniLite benefit from the Litecoin network’s attributes, innovative technology and security.
