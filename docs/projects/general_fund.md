# **Catalyzing Open-Source Progress with The General Fund**

Venture with us on a mission to propel open-source Litecoin projects, crafting a financially inclusive tomorrow, today.

Managed by the Litecoin Foundation, the General Fund is a specialized pool of resources dedicated to backing Litecoin-related free and open-source projects along with their earnest contributors. This fund thrives on the generosity of altruistic individuals and visionary organizations.

Eligibility for support from the General Fund hinges on the following criteria:

- The project should be Litecoin-centric.
- It must embrace an open-source ethos.
- It should exemplify high quality and hold the potential to significantly advance the Litecoin ecosystem.

Each funding application to the General Fund undergoes a thorough review by the Litecoin FOSS Council. The evaluation encompasses the following aspects:

- The project's alignment with the Litecoin Foundation's mission.
- The feasibility and anticipated impact of the project.
- Leadership and the competency of the team driving the project.
- The financial need underlying the project.

The General Fund has been the cornerstone for a wide array of Litecoin-oriented initiatives, covering:

- Development of new Litecoin and Litecoin-adjacent software.
- Augmentation of existing free and open-source software.
- Education dissemination and community outreach concerning Litecoin.
- Conducting research on Litecoin-centric topics.

Should the vision of fostering open-source innovation resonate with you, you are warmly invited to extend your support to the General Fund. Contributions of Litecoin or fiat currency are welcome and can be made [here](https://lite.space).

Litecoin Foundation, Inc. Singapore (UEN: 201709179W), operates as a public charity with the pivotal goal of funding Litecoin-related free and open-source projects, inclusive of educational and research endeavors.

Our aspiration is to create a sustainable ecosystem with steady funding to back the contributors to Litecoin and FOSS (free and open-source) tools. To realize this vision, we have unfurled a platform exclusively dedicated to this mission. Donors can explore the Litecoin Foundation web platform [https://lite.space](https://lite.space), where they can either earmark gifts for specific project realms or channel contributions to our general fund.
