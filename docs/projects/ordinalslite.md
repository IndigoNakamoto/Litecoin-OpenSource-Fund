## About this project

Ordinals Lite is a pioneering initiative that brings the innovative concept of Ordinal Theory to Litecoin, transforming individual satoshis into unique, trackable assets. Leveraging the ideas proposed by Charlie Lee, the creator of Litecoin, in 2012, and originally implemented by Casey Rodarmor on Bitcoin, Ordinals Lite is a reflection of Litecoin's roots in technological advancement. By enabling ordinal numbers as stable identifiers for various assets such as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), accounts, or stablecoins, it paves the way for creating rare, collectable assets and Litecoin-native digital artifacts within the existing Litecoin infrastructure. As such, Ordinals Lite presents a new frontier in the world of Litecoin, connecting past innovations with the future of blockchain technology.
