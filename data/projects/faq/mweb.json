            {
            "question": "How does MWEB achieve enhanced privacy?",
            "answer": "MWEB introduces confidential transactions, which obscure the amounts being transferred. This provides heightened privacy and protection against certain types of spam attacks."
            },
            {
            "question": "How does MWEB improve scalability?",
            "answer": "MWEB addresses blockchain scalability by efficiently pruning old transaction data. This reduces the blockchain size, ensuring a more scalable network."
            },
            {
            "question": "What is the MimbleWimble protocol?",
            "answer": "The MimbleWimble protocol is a privacy and scalability solution initially proposed for Bitcoin. MWEB draws inspiration from this protocol to achieve its objectives for Litecoin."
            },
            {
            "question": "How does MWEB relate to the main Litecoin blockchain?",
            "answer": "MimbleWimble Extension Blocks work alongside the main Litecoin blockchain. They accommodate confidential transactions and pruning while maintaining compatibility with existing wallets and services. This ensures interoperability and security without compromising Litecoin's robustness."
            },
            {
            "question": "Who is behind the development of MWEB?",

            "question": "How do confidential transactions in MWEB differ from regular transactions?",
            "answer": "Confidential transactions in MWEB obscure the amounts being transferred, ensuring that the details are not publicly visible on the blockchain. Regular transactions, on the other hand, display the transfer amounts."
          },
          {
            "question": "What does 'pruning' mean in the context of MWEB?",
            "answer": "Pruning refers to the process of removing old transaction data from the blockchain. This helps in reducing the overall size of the blockchain, thereby improving its scalability."
          },
          {
            "question": "Will existing Litecoin wallets support MWEB?",
