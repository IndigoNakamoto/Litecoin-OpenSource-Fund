# Propelling Litecoin Open-Source Ventures with The General Fund

Venture with us on a mission to propel open-source Litecoin projects.

Managed by the Litecoin Foundation, the General Fund is a specialized pool of resources dedicated to backing Litecoin-related free and open-source projects and their contributors. This fund thrives on the generosity of altruistic individuals and visionary organizations.

Eligibility for support from the General Fund hinges on the following criteria:

- The project should be Litecoin-centric.
- It must embrace an open-source ethos.
- It should exemplify high quality and hold the potential to significantly advance the Litecoin ecosystem.

Each funding application to the General Fund undergoes a thorough review by the Litecoin FOSS Council. The evaluation encompasses the following aspects:

- The project's alignment with the Litecoin Foundation's mission.
- The feasibility and anticipated impact of the project.
- Leadership and the competency of the team driving the project.
- The financial need underlying the project.

The General Fund has been the cornerstone for a wide array of Litecoin-oriented initiatives, covering:

- Development of new Litecoin and Litecoin-adjacent software.
- Augmentation of existing free and open-source software.
- Education dissemination and community outreach concerning Litecoin.
- Conducting research on Litecoin-centric topics.

Should the vision of fostering open-source innovation resonate with you, you are warmly invited to extend your support to the General Fund.

Litecoin Foundation, Inc. Singapore (UEN: 201709179W), operates as a public charity with the pivotal goal of funding Litecoin-related free and open-source projects, inclusive of educational and research endeavors.

Our aspiration is to create a sustainable ecosystem to back the contributors to Litecoin and FOSS (free and open-source) tools.
