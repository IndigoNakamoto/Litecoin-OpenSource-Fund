# MWEB Integration Milestone: BTCPay Server Now Supports Litecoin MWEB

We are thrilled to announce a major milestone in our mission to enhance privacy and fungibility within the Litecoin ecosystem. Thanks to the incredible efforts of our dedicated developer Hector, BTCPay Server now supports MWEB (Mimblewimble) for Litecoin transactions!

## A Significant Achievement for Litecoin Privacy

This integration marks a significant step forward, empowering users with greater control over their financial privacy. The addition of MWEB to BTCPay Server allows customers to select "Litecoin MWEB" during checkout, enabling confidential transactions directly from MWEB addresses.

## Hector's Remarkable Contribution

Hector's exceptional dedication and expertise have been instrumental in bringing this vision to life. His tireless efforts have culminated in the successful integration of MWEB into BTCPay Server, marking the 2-year anniversary of Litecoin adding MWEB and Taproot.

A demo site showcasing the MWEB payment method is available at [ltcmweb.xyz](https://ltcmweb.xyz).
