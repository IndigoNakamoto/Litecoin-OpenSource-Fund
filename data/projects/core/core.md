## Litecoin Core: Supporting a Decentralized Litecoin Network

Litecoin Core is designed to maintain the integrity of the Litecoin blockchain. Users of Litecoin Core uphold the decentralized nature of Litecoin by running their own full nodes. These nodes adhere to a set of rules, ensuring that everyone uses the same valid Litecoin blockchain.

### Decentralization:

Users who run Litecoin Core nodes contribute to the decentralized nature of Litecoin. Each node follows identical rules, collectively securing the network.

### No Centralized Voting:

Litecoin Core operates without a central voting process. Instead, it relies on software following consistent rules, resulting in unanimous agreement on valid transactions and blocks.

By participating in this shared consensus, Litecoin Core users benefit from:

- Enhanced security for their Litecoins.
- Privacy features not found in other wallets.
- A range of user-friendly interfaces and powerful features.

Join us in supporting the development of Litecoin Core and preserving the principles of a decentralized Litecoin network.
