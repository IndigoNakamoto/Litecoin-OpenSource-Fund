# OrdinalsLite.Market - Litecoin Ordinals Decentralized Exchange

OrdinalsLite.Market is an open source zero-fee trustless Litecoin NFT marketplace based on partially signed litecoin transactions.

## How it works

The seller creates a partially signed litecoin transaction (PSLT) specifying the price of the ordinal. The buyer can then sign the PSLT and broadcast it to the network.

## How to add your collection

All inscriptions can be viewed directly via their inscription number or ID.

In addition, the homepage features collections in a random order. The collection data is taken from the litecoinlabs/collections repo.

In order to have your collection listed, create a pull request on the litecoinlabs/collections repo.
