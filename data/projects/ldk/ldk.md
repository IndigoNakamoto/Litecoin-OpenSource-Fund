# Litecoin Development Kit (LDK)

The **Litecoin Development Kit (LDK)** is an ambitious initiative to bring the power and flexibility of the Bitcoin Development Kit (BDK) to the Litecoin community. With LDK, developers can easily build cross-platform Litecoin wallets, leveraging the core principles of the BDK while accommodating Litecoin's unique features.

## What We're Aiming For:

- **LDK Core Library**: The main library that will allow seamless creation and management of Litecoin wallets across platforms.
- **LDK CLI**: A command-line interface (CLI) wallet library and REPL tool, designed to demonstrate and test the features of the LDK.
- **LDK FFI**: As we're targeting cross-platform compatibility, we are also working on foreign language bindings for the LDK. This is currently experimental but holds promise for broadening the LDK's application reach.
- **LDK Documentation**: Comprehensive, open-source documentation to assist developers in making the most out of the LDK.


## Contribute to the Development

Even if Rust isnâ€™t your forte, there are several ways you can contribute to bringing LDK to life:
- **Developers**: If you're skilled in Rust, we need your expertise in porting and maintaining BDK for Litecoin.
- **Funders**: Support the developers by contributing to the bounty and ongoing development funds.
- **Advocates**: Help spread the word and keep the momentum going.
