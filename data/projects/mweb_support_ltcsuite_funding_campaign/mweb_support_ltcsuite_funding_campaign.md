# MWEB Support in ltcsuite Funding Campaign

## Summary

We invite financial donors and advocates to join our effort in supporting the integration of MimbleWimble Extension Block (MWEB) in ltcsuite. Hector Chu has initiated the development, presenting a prototype code integrating ltcsuite with LW. Your contributions will play a crucial role in advancing this project and enhancing Litecoin functionality. Moreover, this implementation will serve as a reference for MWEB light client support, benefiting third-party wallet developers.

## Current Status

As of January 4, 2024, Hector Chu has submitted the prototype code for integrating ltcsuite with LW. The iOS version is in progress, and efforts are being made to fix dependencies for the Android version. MWEB support is not yet included in ltcsuite but is a crucial step in the development process.

## Reference Implementation for MWEB Light Client Mode

The code submitted through this funding campaign will serve as the reference implementation for MWEB light client mode in ltcsuite. Third-party wallet developers can use this code as a guide to adding MWEB light client support to their applications.

## How to Contribute

**Financial Donors:** Contribute to the funding campaign to provide financial support for the development of MWEB support in ltcsuite. Your contributions will directly contribute to the success of this initiative and the creation of a reference implementation.

**Advocates:** Spread the word and advocate for the MWEB Support in ltcsuite Funding Campaign. Help us reach potential donors and raise awareness about the importance of MWEB support for Litecoin and its role as a reference implementation.
