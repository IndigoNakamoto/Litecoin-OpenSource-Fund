# MWEB Support in ltcsuite Funding Campaign

## Summary

We invite financial donors and advocates to join our effort in supporting the integration of MimbleWimble Extension Block (MWEB) in ltcsuite. Hector Chu has initiated the development. Moreover, this implementation will serve as a reference for MWEB light client support, benefiting third-party wallet developers.

## Reference Implementation for MWEB Light Client Mode

The code submitted through this funding campaign will serve as the reference implementation for MWEB light client mode in ltcsuite. Third-party wallet developers can use this code as a guide to adding MWEB light client support to their applications.

## How to Contribute
