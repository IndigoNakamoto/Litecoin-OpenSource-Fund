# Current Status

As of January 4, 2024, Hector Chu has submitted the prototype code for integrating LTCSuite with LW. The iOS version is in progress, and efforts are being made to fix dependencies for the Android version. MWEB support is not yet included in LTCSuite but is a crucial step in the development process.
