# Update on the MWEB Support in ltcsuite Funding Campaign

As we continue to push forward with integrating Mimblewimble Extension Block (MWEB) functionality into ltcsuite, we're excited to share the progress that has been made, thanks to the contributions of our community and the dedicated work of our developers, notably Hector Chu.

## Progress Highlights

**Completion of Key Milestones:** Hector has successfully completed significant portions of the initial goals, with a particular emphasis on fetching and verifying the MWEB UTXO set. This critical step lays the foundation for enabling privacy and fungibility features in Litecoin through ltcsuite.

**Technical Developments:** The neutrino library, instrumental in the implementation, has been adapted to enhance privacy by fetching the entire mempool set, bypassing the limitations of bloom filters and cfilters. Further advancements include the integration of MWEB headers and leafsets, conforming to the new standard (LIP0006) for fetching relevant MWEB data.

**Current Focus and Future Steps:** While a substantial portion of the work on goal 1 is nearing completion, there are ongoing optimizations and bug fixes. The next stages will focus on identifying and storing outputs relevant to users' wallets and facilitating the spending of these outputs.

## Council Decisions and Funding

The project's council has sent 20 LTC of the 60.11 LTC raised to Hector for his contributions thus far, acknowledging the extensive work completed and the milestones reached. This decision underscores our commitment to rewarding hard work and progress, ensuring that the development continues at a steady pace.
