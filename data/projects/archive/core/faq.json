        {
          "question": "What is a full node?",
          "answer": "A full node is a computer on the Litecoin network that maintains a complete copy of the Litecoin blockchain and actively participates in the validation of transactions and blocks."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why is running a full node important?",
          "answer": "Running a full node contributes to the decentralization and security of the Litecoin network. Full nodes help validate transactions, prevent double-spending, and ensure that the network follows consensus rules."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I run a full node on a Raspberry Pi?",
          "answer": "Yes, it's possible to run a Litecoin full node on a Raspberry Pi. However, it may require some technical expertise, and the node's performance may be limited compared to more powerful hardware."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do I need a fast internet connection to run a full node?",
          "answer": "A stable and reasonably fast internet connection is beneficial for running a full node, as it helps keep the blockchain synchronized and contributes to the network's health. However, it doesn't need to be exceptionally fast for basic node operation."

      "category": "Decentralization",
      "items": [
        {
          "question": "What is decentralization?",
          "answer": "Decentralization is a key principle of cryptocurrencies like Litecoin. It means that no single entity or authority has control over the network. Instead, power and decision-making are distributed among network participants."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why is decentralization important for Litecoin?",
          "answer": "Decentralization ensures that Litecoin is resistant to censorship and single points of failure. It promotes trust in the network and reduces the risk of manipulation or control by any central authority."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are the risks of centralization in cryptocurrency?",
          "answer": "Centralization in cryptocurrency can lead to censorship, control by a small group of entities, and vulnerabilities to attacks. It undermines the principles of decentralization and trustlessness."
        },
        {
          "question": "How does Litecoin's mining process contribute to decentralization?",
          "answer": "Litecoin uses a proof-of-work mining algorithm, which allows miners from around the world to participate in securing the network. This distribution of mining power helps maintain decentralization."
