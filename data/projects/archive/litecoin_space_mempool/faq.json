          "question": "What is a mempool?",
          "answer": "A mempool (short for 'memory pool') is the queue of pending and unconfirmed transactions for a cryptocurrency network node. There is no one global mempool: every node on the network maintains its own mempool, so different nodes may hold different transactions in their mempools."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is a mempool explorer?",
          "answer": "A mempool explorer is a tool that enables you to view real-time and historical information about a node's mempool, visualize its transactions, and search and view those transactions. The litecoinspace.org website invented the concept of visualizing a Litecoin node's mempool as projected blocks."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is a blockchain?",
          "answer": "A blockchain is a distributed ledger that records the transactions for a cryptocurrency network. Miners amend the blockchain ledger by mining new blocks."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is a block explorer?",
          "answer": "A block explorer is a tool that enables you to explore real-time and historical information about the blockchain of a cryptocurrency. This includes data related to blocks, transactions, addresses, and more."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is mining?",
          "answer": "Mining is the process by which unconfirmed transactions in a mempool are confirmed into a block on a blockchain. Miners select unconfirmed transactions from their mempools and arrange them into a block such that they solve a particular math problem."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are mining pools?",
          "answer": "Mining pools are groups of miners that combine their computational power in order to increase the probability of finding new blocks."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are virtual bytes (vB) and weight units (WU)?",
          "answer": "Virtual bytes (vB) and weight units (WU) are used to measure the size of transactions and blocks on the Litecoin network."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is lit/vB?",
          "answer": "The priority of a pending Litecoin Transaction is determined by its feerate, measured in lit/vB."

        {
          "question": "How do miners earn rewards?",
          "answer": "The first miner on the network to find a suitable block earns all the transaction fees from the transactions in that block. As a result, miners tend to prioritize transactions with higher transaction fees."

        },
        {
          "question": "Why do miners join mining pools?",
          "answer": "Miners join mining pools to increase their chances of earning rewards more regularly and evenly. In a mining pool, miners work together, and when the pool finds a block, the rewards are distributed among pool members based on their contributed computational power."

        {
          "question": "How do Litecoin transactions work?",
          "answer": "Litecoin transactions involve sending and receiving Litecoin from one wallet to another. Transactions are recorded on the Litecoin blockchain and are typically confirmed by miners. The sender initiates the transaction by signing it with their private key, and it is then added to the mempool for inclusion in a block."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the role of transaction fees in Litecoin?",
          "answer": "Transaction fees are payments made by the sender to incentivize miners to include their transaction in the next block. Transactions with higher fees are usually prioritized by miners because they earn more for confirming those transactions."
