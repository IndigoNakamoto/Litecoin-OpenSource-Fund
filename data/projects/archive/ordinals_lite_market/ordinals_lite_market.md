# OrdinalsLite.Market - Litecoin Ordinals Decentralized Exchange

**OrdinalsLite.Market** revolutionizes the world of Litecoin NFTs by offering a decentralized, open-source marketplace. Leveraging the power of Partially Signed Litecoin Transactions (PSLTs), it enables a secure and trustless environment for trading Litecoin NFTs.

## How It Works - A Trustless Trading Experience

**Sellers:**

1. **Create a PSLT**: Specify your NFT's price by creating a partially signed Litecoin transaction. This transaction includes the terms of the sale but awaits completion by a buyer.

**Buyers:**

1. **Sign & Complete**: Once you've found an NFT you wish to purchase, complete the transaction by signing it. This action confirms the terms set by the seller.
2. **Broadcast to Network**: After signing, broadcast the transaction to the Litecoin network. This step finalizes the purchase and transfers ownership of the NFT.

## Adding Your Collection - Be Part of the Marketplace

1. **Visibility of Inscriptions**: Each NFT, or inscription, is uniquely identifiable via its inscription number or ID. This feature ensures easy access and visibility for buyers.
2. **Featured Collections**: Our homepage showcases a variety of collections, displayed in random order, giving equal visibility to all creators.
3. **Contribute Your Collection**:
   - **Prepare Your Collection**: Ensure your collection meets our guidelines and standards.
   - **Submit a Pull Request**: Visit the `litecoinlabs/collections` repository on GitHub. Submit a pull request with your collection's details for review.
   - **Await Approval**: Our team will review your submission. Once approved, your collection will be featured on OrdinalsLite.Market.
