The Litecoin Foundation is a 501(c)(3) public charity that aims to support and maintain a sustainable ecosystem of funding for free and open-source projects and contributors, especially those related to Litecoin and projects that help Litecoin flourish.

Our mission is to champion open-source initiatives that bolster Litecoin's growth and its broader ecosystem, ensuring a future where technology is inclusive, secure, and truly open for all. Through strategic funding, education, and community engagement, we aim to pave the way for a more interconnected and decentralized tomorrow, with Litecoin at its heart.
