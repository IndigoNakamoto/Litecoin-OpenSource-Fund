The Litecoin Foundation FOSS Council is a 501(c)(3) public charity that aims to support and maintain a sustainable ecosystem of funding for free and open-source projects and contributors, especially those related to Litecoin and projects that help Litecoin flourish.

We believe that free and open-source software is essential to the future of the internet and the world. It allows people to collaborate and share knowledge, without being locked into proprietary software or hardware. This is particularly important for Litecoin, a decentralized digital currency that relies on the open-source development community to maintain and improve its software.

The Litecoin Foundation FOSS Council provides funding for various Litecoin-related projects, including:

- Development of new Litecoin & Litecoin-adjacent software
- Improvement of existing free and open-source software related to Litecoin
- Education and outreach about Litecoin
- Research into Litecoin-related topics

We believe that by supporting these projects, we can help make Litecoin more accessible, robust, secure, and decentralized. We also believe that these projects have the potential to revolutionize the way we think about individual sovereignty, financial independence, and liberty.

The Litecoin Foundation FOSS Council is committed to transparency and accountability. We publish our financial statements and board meeting minutes online. We also have a rigorous review process for all projects that we fund.

We believe that the Litecoin Foundation FOSS Council can play a vital role in the future of Litecoin. We are committed to supporting the development of free and open-source software, and we believe that Litecoin has the potential to change the world.
