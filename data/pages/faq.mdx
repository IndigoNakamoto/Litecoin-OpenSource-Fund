## What are you doing at Lite.space?

**Lite.space is part of The Litecoin Foundation a non-profit organization, 
registered in Singapore (UEN: 201709179W), whose mission is to promote the adoption, 
education & development of Litecoin (LTC)**

We want to see contributors to Litecoin Core and FOSS (free and open-source)
tools supported by a sustainable ecosystem and consistent funding, so we set up
a platform to do just that. Donors can come to the Lite.space web platform and
either recommend gifts to specific project areas or contribute to our general
fund.

We distribute grants to a wide variety of contributor types (developers,
designers, researchers, educators, reviewers...), but only to those working on
Litecoin and open-source projects that will improve public access to Litecoin
infrastructure.

## How are funds distributed?

Donations to the general fund will be distributed quarterly by our council. We
evaluate and assess applications to make sure any grants are awarded to high
impact projects in the Litecoin space.

We also maintain a list of mission-focused, open-source projects that have been
vetted by our Council for continuous funding. Donors may recommend their
gifts be directed to these specific projects; Lite.space will consider these
recommendations but will retain sole discretion as to how funds are distributed.

## How much of my donation goes towards individuals and projects supported by Lite.space?

All donations to the general fund and specific, mission-aligned FOSS projects
are 100% passed through to Lite.space grant recipients. We try our best to find
donor matching partners that cover the transaction fees that incur with each
donation, regardless of payment method. Please [reach out] if you want to help
us cover these costs.

## Do you distribute grants in Litecoin or fiat?

We distribute grants in Litecoin.



## How do you collect Litecoin donations?

We use BTCPay Server and Electrum-LTC to collect Litecoin on chain. This ensures that we pay no 
processing fees and your funds are stretched even farther.

## How can I communicate with you?

The best way to communicate with us is via email support@lite.space.

**You can also write to us at:**

    Litecoin Foundation Ltd.  
    111 North Bridge Rd  
    #08-11 Peninsula Plaza  
    Singapore 179098  

## How often are funding opportunities announced?

Funding opportunities are announced quarterly, depending on funding
availability.

All projects should be free and open-source and related to Litecoin or an
ancillary technology (like Tor, etc.) which helps Litecoin use. Your project must
align with the mission of our charity to be eligible for donations.


## Tell me more about your board. How does it work?

We have seven board members and we vote by majority. All standard decisions (like
which new projects are added to the website or which projects will receive
grants allocated from the general fund) are made by simple majority (4-3), while
board-related changes will require 5-2 majority. New members to the board will
be announced publicly.

## Are you really 100% passthrough?

Yes, really. We have an operational budget to cover lawyers, accountants, and
basic operational costs, but they aren't paid from your donations to projects.


## Are my donations tax deductible?

No, Lite.space is part of The Litecoin Foundation a non-profit organization, 
registered in Singapore (UEN: 201709179W). We are still in the process of 
finalizing our 501(c)(3) application to allow tax deductions for American 
Citizens.
