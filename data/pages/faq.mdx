{/*QA*/}
### How are funds distributed?
Our council distributes funds from the general fund quarterly. We prioritize impactful Litecoin projects. Additionally, donors can recommend specific mission-aligned open-source projects for funding. While we consider donor recommendations, the final decision on distribution remains with Lite.Space.

### What percentage of my donation directly supports projects?
100% of donations to the general fund and specific open-source projects go to grant recipients.

### In what form are grants distributed?
Grants are given in Litecoin.

### How do you process Litecoin donations?
We employ BTCPay Server and Electrum-LTC for on-chain Litecoin donations. All donations are stored in a multi-sig wallet overseen by our council.

### Are my donations tax deductible?
Currently, Lite.Space, under The Litecoin Foundation in Singapore, doesn't offer tax deductions for American Citizens. We're working on this feature. For substantial donations, U.S. citizens should [email us](support@lite.Space).

### Can you elaborate on your Council?
Our Council comprises five members. Standard decisions are made by a simple majority (3-2), whereas council-specific changes necessitate a 4-1 majority. We publicly announce new Council members.

### Is Lite.Space truly 100% passthrough?
Absolutely. Our operational costs, such as legal and accounting services, are separate from project donations.

{/*QA*/}
### When do you announce funding opportunities?
We declare funding opportunities quarterly, based on available funds. Projects should be open-source, related to Litecoin, or support Litecoin usage and align with our mission.
