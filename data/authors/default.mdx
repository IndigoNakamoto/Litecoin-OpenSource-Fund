The Litecoin Foundation, Inc. in Singapore (UEN: 201709179W) operates as a public charity with a primary goal of funding Litecoin-centered free and open-source projects alongside educational and research initiatives.

## Our Vision
We aspire to foster a sustainable ecosystem that provides consistent support to contributors to Litecoin and Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) tools. Our ambition is to ensure that innovative projects within the Litecoin community receive the necessary resources to flourish and contribute to the public's access to Litecoin infrastructure.

## Our Platform
To actualize this vision, we've developed a dedicated platform, Lite.Space, where donors can extend their support. Through Lite.Space, donors can direct their contributions to specific project areas or contribute to our general fund, creating a wave of support that pushes the Litecoin community and open-source projects forward.
