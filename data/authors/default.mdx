Litecoin Foundation, Inc. Singapore (UEN: 201709179W), is a public charity which aims to fund Litecoin-related free and open-source projects, including educational and research initiatives.

Our vision is to ensure that contributors to Litecoin and FOSS (free and open-source) tools are backed by a sustainable ecosystem with consistent funding. To bring this vision to life, we have established a platform dedicated to this mission. Donors can visit the Litecoin Foundation web platform https://lite.space and either recommend gifts to specific project areas or contribute to our general fund.

Grants are distributed quarterly by our council. We undertake a thorough evaluation of applications to ensure that grants are directed to high-impact projects within the Litecoin space. We distribute these grants to a diverse set of contributors including developers, designers, researchers, educators, reviewers, among others. However, our primary focus remains on those working on Litecoin and open-source projects that amplify public access to Litecoin infrastructure.
