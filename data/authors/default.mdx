Litecoin Foundation, Inc. (EIN 88-1262826) is a 501(c)(3) public charity which aims to fund Litecoin-related free and open-source projects, including educational and research initiatives.

Our vision is to ensure that contributors to Litecoin and FOSS (free and open-source) tools are backed by a sustainable ecosystem with consistent funding. To bring this vision to life, we have established a platform dedicated to this mission. Donors can visit the Litecoin Foundation web platform and either recommend gifts to specific project areas or contribute to our general fund.

Grants are distributed quarterly by our council. We undertake a thorough evaluation of applications to ensure that grants are directed to high-impact projects within the Litecoin space. We distribute these grants to a diverse set of contributors including developers, designers, researchers, educators, reviewers, among others. However, our primary focus remains on those working on Litecoin and open-source projects that amplify public access to Litecoin infrastructure.

Understanding the importance of transparency and decentralization, we have designed a decision-making process that avoids undue concentration of power. Hence, we've established a transparent, public-facing, and accountable council responsible for all organizational decisions. The members of the Litecoin Foundation council are deeply committed to the values of the decentralized world, and are dedicated to supporting and ensuring the longevity of free and open-source technology like Litecoin.
