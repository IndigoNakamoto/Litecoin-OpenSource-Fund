# Introducing Lite.Space: Empowering Litecoin Development, One Grant at a Time!

Lite.Space is excited to unveil a groundbreaking platform dedicated to accelerating Litecoin's growth and development. Powered by The Litecoin Foundation, a Singapore-registered non-profit (UEN: 201709179W), Lite.Space is on a mission to drive Litecoin (LTC) adoption, education, and open-source innovation.

## What is Lite.Space?

Lite.Space is the brainchild of The Litecoin Foundation, committed to supporting Litecoin Core contributors and open-source projects through sustainable funding. Here's how you can get involved:

**Apply for a Grant:** The Litecoin Foundation Lite.Space Council offers grants for innovative open-source projects that enhance the Litecoin ecosystem. Whether you're developing new Litecoin software, improving existing FOSS related to Litecoin, promoting Litecoin education, or conducting Litecoin-related research, you can be a part of this transformative journey.

**Programs:** Lite.Space offers multiple grant programs to suit your project's needs:

- **Lite.Space Website Listing:** Feature your project on our platform and attract potential donor support.
- **General Grants:** Access quarterly grants from the Lite.Space General Fund to support impactful Litecoin ecosystem projects.
- **Long-Term Support Grants:** Dedicate support to vital Litecoin framework projects, ensuring ongoing development and maintenance.

## How to Reach Us

Have questions or need assistance? Reach out to us on Twitter at [LTCFoundation](https://www.twitter.com/ltcfoundation) and use the hashtag #LiteSpace.

## Transparency & Impact

Lite.Space is committed to transparency and impact. Here are some key points:

- **Funds Distribution:** We distribute funds from the general fund quarterly, prioritizing impactful Litecoin projects. Donors can recommend specific projects for funding, and while we consider these recommendations, the final decision rests with Lite.Space.
- **100% Support:** Every donation to the general fund and specific open-source projects goes directly to grant recipients.
- **Grants in Litecoin:** Grants are provided in Litecoin, ensuring seamless support for Litecoin-related endeavors.
- **Secure Donations:** We employ BTCPay Server and Electrum-LTC for on-chain Litecoin donations, with all contributions securely stored in a multi-sig wallet overseen by our council.
- **Tax Deductions:** While we work on offering tax deductions for American Citizens, currently, we do not provide this feature. For significant donations, U.S. citizens can reach out to support@Lite.Space.

Join us in revolutionizing Litecoin's future! Lite.Space is built on transparency, community-driven governance, and the unwavering support of Litecoin enthusiasts like you. Together, we'll light up the world of Litecoin development and adoption.

Stay tuned for funding opportunities, governance updates, and more! Let's make Litecoin shine brighter than ever before.
