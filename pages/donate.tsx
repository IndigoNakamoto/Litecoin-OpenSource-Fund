          <p>
            Litecoin Foundation Inc. is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization whose
            mission is to promote the adoption, awareness & development of
            Litecoin & its ecosystem.

          <p>
            Since Litecoin is a fairly launched, decentralized cryptocurrency,
            Litecoin Foundationâ€™s primary source of financial support is through
            individual donations. Your contribution helps Litecoin Foundation
            continue to fund research and development, education, community
            support, partnerships and advocacy related to Litecoin,
            cryptocurrency and financial privacy.
